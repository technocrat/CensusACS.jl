# ACS.jl Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for ACS.jl, a Julia package for retrieving data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) API.

## Overview

ACS.jl provides a simple and robust interface to access American Community Survey data through the Census Bureau's API. The package supports:

- Data retrieval from 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year ACS estimates
- Various geographic levels (state, county, tract, block group)
- Automatic handling of state FIPS codes
- Robust error handling and retries
- DataFrame output format
- Separate functions for estimates and margin of error values

## Quick Start

```julia
using ACS

# Set your Census API key
ENV["CENSUS_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"

# Get total population estimates for all states (5-year ACS)
df = get_acs(
    variables = ["B01003_001E"],
    geography = "state"
)

# Get margin of error for total population
df_moe = get_acs_moe(
    variables = ["B01003_001M"],
    geography = "state"
)
```

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ACS")
```
